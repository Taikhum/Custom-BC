                                                                                  -Taikhum Kothambawala	

The processor supports the following features as required by batch-2, while following bc guidelines (ref 'man bc' for details) - 

1. Support numbers both integers and fractional numbers                                    

2. Support variables (checks for the constraints on variable names supported)                

3. Allows only single line comments

4. Support simple expressions and boolean operations (list can be found using man bc)      

5. Support simple statements, compound statements (e.g. {a=2; b=3}), conditional statements (if, if else)

The program is currently successfully compiled. 

- Run "./custom-bc" in order to get the features

In order to compile the entire program in case any errors exist, kindly run "make" in order to activate the commands stated in the make file.

NOTE : In order to allow single line non variable dependent statements (i.e 2+1) kindly use the "=" sign (eg =2+1;)
       Also, kindly use the ";" key at the end of each statement before pressing enter to feed the processor , else the program tends to be buggy.

Example code :

a=2;
b=3;
if a%2==0
{
	print 0;
}
else
{
	print 1;
}
